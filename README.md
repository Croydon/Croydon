### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael a.k.a Croydon _[ kroid-n ]_

I do work on many open source projects across the board.
Sometimes for University related work, but mostly self-motiviated in my free time.

If you want _**general support**_ for some project, please use the respective issue tracker in the repositories.

If you want to contact me directly for _**personal or sensitive requests**_, you can do so via
  * Matrix: @Croydon:matrix.org
  * Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cr0ydon/
  * or email (my email-address can be found in my GitHub profile)
